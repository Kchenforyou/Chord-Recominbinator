# Chord-Recominbinator
Chord-Recombinator is a Python script assisting musicians with composition. The user enters a string of musical notes (i.e. C, D, E, G, and B) and the script returns all the possible chords that can be created from the notes. For instance, the notes CDEGB will return the following chords:
-C Major (CEG)
-E minor (EGB)
-G Major (GBD)
-C Sus2	(CDG)
-C Major seventh (CEGB)
-E minor seventh (EGBD)

This software is helpful for composers trying to compose with a limited set of notes, allowing them to explore different combinations of notes within such a set. A working version of this software is linked here at [chordguru.glitch.me](https://chordguru.glitch.me/chords/index.html), done in collaboration with [Alex Chen](https://github.com/alexchen2).
